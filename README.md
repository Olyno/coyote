## Contribute

Contributions are welcome. Here is some ways where you can contribute to the project:

**I'm a developer:**

Awesome! You can help us with code, like review pull requests, add new features according to [the roadmap](https://github.com/Olyno/coyote/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), or fix bugs!

**I'm a designer:**

Awesome! You can help us with designs, like create better designs, choose better colors etc... and [when custom themes will be available](https://github.com/Olyno/coyote/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), you can contribute by adding new themes!

**I'm not a developer, neither a designer:**

Awesome! You can help us with translations. Coyote has a multiple languages support, available in the directory ``assets/languages``. It's simple ``.yml`` file, really simple to recreate and edit.
